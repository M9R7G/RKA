# RKA

In this proyect the behavior of a lego robot is implemented. The robot is ment to be able to follow a black line drawed on a white floor, and be able as well to intrepretate a trafic light patterns(blue, red, green) drawed next to the black line. 

In this experiment the robot must be able to perform three laps throught a closed ciruit draw with the black line without goin out of the circuit. The circuit has some outer routes and the robot must take the outer route that matches a given trafic light pattern in the given specific lap(1 to 3).

The robot have equiped two whells and a electric engine in order to move, an array of laser sensors to detec the line on the floor, and an RGB sensor for the trafic light patterns.
